# Button

A button allows us to highlight actions in the product and make them easily
perceived and achievable through just one click.

<Props of={Input} />

## When to use it

Use buttons when users need to either navigate through a product or perform a specific task.

## Usage guidelines

- **Do** always label a button in a clear and understandable way
- **Do** always think about the priority of the action to be taken when choosing a type of button
- **Do** position buttons in a predictable and coherent way throughout the product.
- **Do** combine different button types if you have more than one button in a specific screen
- **Do** use a loading state to provide feedback for our user when the action revolves around saving or
  inputting information, especially when it could take some seconds.

## Content guidelines

- **Do** always start the label with an actionable verb accompanied by a noun to provide enough context (example: "Confirm order").
  The only exceptions are the following common actions: "Save"; "Cancel"; and "Close".
- **Do** keep the label to a maximum of 3 words
- **Do not** capitalize all words of the label, just the first word or brand/product words (such as Apple Pay, for example)
